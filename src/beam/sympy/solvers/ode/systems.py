    Helper function that determines the type of the system of ODEs for solving with :obj:`sympy.solvers.ode.systems.linodesolve()`

    Explanation
    ===========

    This function takes in the coefficient matrix and/or the non-homogeneous term
    and returns the type of the equation that can be solved by :obj:`sympy.solvers.ode.systems.linodesolve()`.

    If the system is constant coefficient homogeneous, then "type1" is returned
    If the system is constant coefficient non-homogeneous, then "type2" is returned
    If the system is non-constant coefficient homogeneous, then "type3" is returned
    If the system is non-constnt coefficient non-homogeneous, then "type4" is returned

    Note that, if the system of ODEs is of "type3" or "type4", then along with the type,
    the commutative antiderivative of the coefficient matrix is also returned.

    If the system cannot be solved by :obj:`sympy.solvers.ode.systems.linodesolve()`, then
    NotImplementedError is raised.

    Parameters
    ==========

    A : Matrix
        Coefficient matrix of the system of ODEs
    b : Matrix or None
        Non-homogeneous term of the system. The default value is None.
        If this argument is None, then the system is assumed to be homogeneous.

def linear_ode_to_matrix(eqs, funcs, t, order):
    r"""
    Convert a linear system of ODEs to matrix form

    Explanation
    ===========

    Express a system of linear ordinary differential equations as a single
    matrix differential equation [1]. For example the system $x' = x + y + 1$
    and $y' = x - y$ can be represented as

    .. math:: A_1 X' + A_0 X = b

    where $A_1$ and $A_0$ are $2 \times 2$ matrices and $b$, $X$ and $X'$ are
    $2 \times 1$ matrices with $X = [x, y]^T$.

    Higher-order systems are represented with additional matrices e.g. a
    second-order system would look like

    .. math:: A_2 X'' + A_1 X' + A_0 X = b

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import (Function, Symbol, Matrix, Eq)
    >>> from sympy.solvers.ode.systems import linear_ode_to_matrix
    >>> t = Symbol('t')
    >>> x = Function('x')
    >>> y = Function('y')

    We can create a system of linear ODEs like

    >>> eqs = [
    ...     Eq(x(t).diff(t), x(t) + y(t) + 1),
    ...     Eq(y(t).diff(t), x(t) - y(t)),
    ... ]
    >>> funcs = [x(t), y(t)]
    >>> order = 1 # 1st order system

    Now ``linear_ode_to_matrix`` can represent this as a matrix
    differential equation.

    >>> (A1, A0), b = linear_ode_to_matrix(eqs, funcs, t, order)
    >>> A1
    Matrix([
    [1, 0],
    [0, 1]])
    >>> A0
    Matrix([
    [-1, -1],
    [-1,  1]])
    >>> b
    Matrix([
    [1],
    [0]])

    The original equations can be recovered from these matrices:

    >>> eqs_mat = Matrix([eq.lhs - eq.rhs for eq in eqs])
    >>> X = Matrix(funcs)
    >>> A1 * X.diff(t) + A0 * X - b == eqs_mat
    True

    If the system of equations has a maximum order greater than the
    order of the system specified, a ODEOrderError exception is raised.

    >>> eqs = [Eq(x(t).diff(t, 2), x(t).diff(t) + x(t)), Eq(y(t).diff(t), y(t) + x(t))]
    >>> linear_ode_to_matrix(eqs, funcs, t, 1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ODEOrderError: Cannot represent system in 1-order form

    If the system of equations is nonlinear, then ODENonlinearError is
    raised.

    >>> eqs = [Eq(x(t).diff(t), x(t) + y(t)), Eq(y(t).diff(t), y(t)**2 + x(t))]
    >>> linear_ode_to_matrix(eqs, funcs, t, 1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ODENonlinearError: The system of ODEs is nonlinear.

    Parameters
    ==========

    eqs : list of sympy expressions or equalities
        The equations as expressions (assumed equal to zero).
    funcs : list of applied functions
        The dependent variables of the system of ODEs.
    t : symbol

    Matrix exponential $\exp(A*t)$ for the matrix ``A`` and scalar ``t``.

    Explanation
    ===========

    This functions returns the $\exp(A*t)$ by doing a simple
    matrix multiplication:

    .. math:: \exp(A*t) = P * expJ * P^{-1}

    where $expJ$ is $\exp(J*t)$. $J$ is the Jordan normal
    form of $A$ and $P$ is matrix such that:

    .. math:: A = P * J * P^{-1}

    The matrix exponential $\exp(A*t)$ appears in the solution of linear
    differential equations. For example if $x$ is a vector and $A$ is a matrix
    then the initial value problem

    .. math:: \frac{dx(t)}{dt} = A \times x(t),   x(0) = x0

    has the unique solution

    .. math:: x(t) = \exp(A t) x0

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Symbol, Matrix, pprint

def linodesolve(A, t, b=None, B=None, type="auto", doit=False):
    r"""
    System of n equations linear first-order differential equations

    Explanation
    ===========

    This solver solves the system of ODEs of the follwing form:

    .. math::
        X'(t) = A(t) X(t) +  b(t)

    Here, $A(t)$ is the coefficient matrix, $X(t)$ is the vector of n independent variables,
    $b(t)$ is the non-homogeneous term and $X'(t)$ is the derivative of $X(t)$

    Depending on the properties of $A(t)$ and $b(t)$, this solver evaluates the solution
    differently.

    When $A(t)$ is constant coefficient matrix and $b(t)$ is zero vector i.e. system is homogeneous,
    the solution is:

    .. math::
        X(t) = \exp(A t) C

    Here, $C$ is a vector of constants and $A$ is the constant coefficient matrix.

    When $A(t)$ is constant coefficient matrix and $b(t)$ is non-zero i.e. system is non-homogeneous,
    the solution is:

    .. math::
        X(t) = e^{A t} ( \int e^{- A t} b \,dt + C)

    When $A(t)$ is coefficient matrix such that its commutative with its antiderivative $B(t)$ and
    $b(t)$ is a zero vector i.e. system is homogeneous, the solution is:

    .. math::
        X(t) = \exp(B(t)) C

    When $A(t)$ is commutative with its antiderivative $B(t)$ and $b(t)$ is non-zero i.e. system is
    non-homogeneous, the solution is:

    .. math::
        X(t) =  e^{B(t)} ( \int e^{-B(t)} b(t) \,dt + C)

    The final solution is the general solution for all the four equations since a constant coefficient
    matrix is always commutative with its antidervative.

    Parameters
    ==========

    A : Matrix
        Coefficient matrix of the system of linear first order ODEs.
    t : Symbol
        Independent variable in the system of ODEs.
    b : Matrix or None
        Non-homogeneous term in the system of ODEs. If None is passed,
        a homogeneous system of ODEs is assumed.
    B : Matrix or None
        Antiderivative of the coefficient matrix. If the antiderivative
        is not passed and the solution requires the term, then the solver
        would compute it internally.
    type : String
        Type of the system of ODEs passed. Depending on the type, the
        solution is evaluated. The type values allowed and the corresponding
        system it solves are: "type1" for constant coefficient homogeneous
        "type2" for constant coefficient non-homogeneous, "type3" for non-constant
        coefficient homogeneous and "type4" for non-constant coefficient non-homogeneous.
        The default value is "auto" which will let the solver decide the correct type of
        the system passed.
    doit : Boolean
        Evaluate the solution if True, default value is False

    Examples
    ========

    To solve the system of ODEs using this function directly, several things must be
    done in the right order. Wrong inputs to the function will lead to incorrect results.

    >>> from sympy import symbols, Function, Eq
    >>> from sympy.solvers.ode.systems import canonical_odes, linear_ode_to_matrix, linodesolve, linodesolve_type
    >>> from sympy.solvers.ode.subscheck import checksysodesol
    >>> f, g = symbols("f, g", cls=Function)
    >>> x, a = symbols("x, a")
    >>> funcs = [f(x), g(x)]
    >>> eqs = [Eq(f(x).diff(x) - f(x), a*g(x) + 1), Eq(g(x).diff(x) + g(x), a*f(x))]

    Here, it is important to note that before we derive the coefficient matrix, it is
    important to get the system of ODEs into the desired form. For that we will use
    :obj:`sympy.solvers.ode.systems.canonical_odes()`.

    >>> eqs = canonical_odes(eqs, funcs, x)
    >>> eqs
    [Eq(Derivative(f(x), x), a*g(x) + f(x) + 1), Eq(Derivative(g(x), x), a*f(x) - g(x))]

    Now, we will use :obj:`sympy.solvers.ode.systems.linear_ode_to_matrix()` to get the coefficient matrix and the
    non-homogeneous term if it is there.

    >>> (A1, A0), b = linear_ode_to_matrix(eqs, funcs, x, 1)
    >>> A = -A0

    We have the coefficient matrices and the non-homogeneous term ready. Now, we can use
    :obj:`sympy.solvers.ode.systems.linodesolve_type()` to get the information for the system of ODEs
    to finally pass it to the solver.

    >>> system_info = linodesolve_type(A, x, b=b)
    >>> sol_vector = linodesolve(A, x, b=b, B=system_info['antiderivative'], type=system_info['type'])

    Now, we can prove if the solution is correct or not by using :obj:`sympy.solvers.ode.subscheck.checksysodesol()`

    >>> sol = [Eq(f, s) for f, s in zip(funcs, sol_vector)]
    >>> checksysodesol(eqs, sol)
    (True, [0, 0])

    We can also use the doit method to evaluate the solutions passed by the function.

    >>> sol_vector_evaluated = linodesolve(A, x, b=b, type="type2", doit=True)

    Now, we will look at a system of ODEs which is non-constant.

    >>> eqs = [Eq(f(x).diff(x), f(x) + x*g(x)), Eq(g(x).diff(x), -x*f(x) + g(x))]

    The system defined above is already in the desired form, so we don't have to convert it.

    >>> (A1, A0), b = linear_ode_to_matrix(eqs, funcs, x, 1)
    >>> A = -A0

    A user can also pass the commutative antidervative required for type3 and type4 system of ODEs.
    Passing an incorrect one will lead to incorrect results. If the coefficient matrix is not commutative
    with its antiderivative, then :obj:`sympy.solvers.ode.systems.linodesolve_type()` raises a NotImplementedError.
    If it does have a commutative antiderivative, then the function just returns the information about the system.

    >>> system_info = linodesolve_type(A, x, b=b)

    Now, we can pass the antiderivative as an argument to get the solution. If the system information is not
    passed, then the solver will compute the required arguments internally.

    >>> sol_vector = linodesolve(A, x, b=b)

    Once again, we can verify the solution obtained.

    >>> sol = [Eq(f, s) for f, s in zip(funcs, sol_vector)]
    >>> checksysodesol(eqs, sol)
    (True, [0, 0])

    Function that solves for highest order derivatives in a system

    Explanation
    ===========

    This function inputs a system of ODEs and based on the system,
    the dependent variables and their highest order, returns the system
    in the following form:

    .. math::
        X'(t) = A(t) X(t) + b(t)

    Here, $X(t)$ is the vector of dependent variables of lower order, $A(t)$ is
    the coefficient matrix, $b(t)$ is the non-homogeneous term and $X'(t)$ is the
    vector of dependent variables in their respective highest order. We use the term
    canonical form to imply the system of ODEs which is of the above form.

    If the system passed has a non-linear term with multiple solutions, then a list of
    systems is returned in its canonical form.

    Returns a dictionary with details of the eqs if every equation is constant coefficient

    Explanation
    ===========

    This function takes the eqs, converts it into a form Ax = b where x is a vector of terms
    containing dependent variables and their derivatives till their maximum order. If it is
    possible to convert eqs into Ax = b, then all the equations in eqs are linear otherwise
    they are non-linear.

    To check if the equations are constant coefficient, we need to check if all the terms in
    A obtained above are constant or not.

    To check if the equations are homogeneous or not, we need to check if b is a zero matrix
    or not.
