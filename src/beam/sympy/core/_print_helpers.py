    The default implementation of printing for SymPy classes.

    This implements a hack that allows us to print elements of built-in
    Python containers in a readable way. Natively Python uses ``repr()``
    even if ``str()`` was explicitly requested. Mix in this trait into
    a class to get proper default printing.

    This also adds support for LaTeX printing in jupyter notebooks.
